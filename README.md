### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the place where most of my public code is stored. Mostly you'll find JavaScript/TypeScript stuff, but I'm also a fan of Python, Golang, decentralized tech, blockchain (yeah I know), [tools](https://github.com/cktang88/mydevenv) that optimize developer productivity, and more. 

Feel free to browse, watch, star or fork my code! 

Happy coding! :sunglasses: :computer:

PS - I may or may not start a blog [:speech_balloon:](https://kwuang.me/)


And if you are a fan of Ascii games (this one I didn't make):
