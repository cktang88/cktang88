### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the place where most of my public code is stored. Mostly you'll find JavaScript/TypeScript stuff, but I'm also a fan of Python, Golang, decentralized tech, blockchain (yeah I know), tools that optimize developer productivity, and more. 

Feel free to browse, watch, star or fork my code! 

Happy coding! :sunglasses: :computer:
